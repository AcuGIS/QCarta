Quail
==================================================



Quail is a QGIS Server Layer Server and Administration UI.

You can easily publish your QGIS Projects to create OGC Web Services

You can also create OGC Web Services directly from many Geospatial formats, such as GeoTIFFs, PostGIS, Shape Files, and GeoPackages.

Layers are served via integrated MapProxy and can be either Public or Authenticated.
